## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- Homebrew installation instructions as primary installation method (Option 1)
- Support for "latest" tag in Go version (queries https://go.dev/VERSION?m=text)
- Support for npm dist-tags (stable, latest, next) for Claude Code
- UV self-update capability via official install script

### Changed
- **Claude Code default changed from "latest" to "stable"** (2.1.29 → 2.1.17)
  - More stable for production use
  - Users can still use `latest` or `next` if needed
- **UV installation now uses official install script** instead of manual binary download
  - Enables `uv self update` inside containers
  - Installs to ~/.local/bin as claude user
- **UV default version changed to "latest"** (was 0.5.11, now gets 0.9.28+)
- **Go default version changed to "latest"** (was 1.23.5, now gets 1.25.6+)
  - Automatically queries go.dev for newest stable version
- Updated all documentation to reflect new defaults

### Installation
- Homebrew tap available: `brew tap jedi4ever/tap && brew install dclaude`
- Added instructions for tap setup, upgrade, and versioned installs

### Technical
- Added `getNpmVersionByTag()` to fetch versions for any npm dist-tag
- Modified `DetermineImageName()` to handle dist-tags (stable, latest, next)
- Dockerfile now queries go.dev/VERSION for latest Go version when GO_VERSION=latest
- UV install script supports version-in-URL format (https://astral.sh/uv/{version}/install.sh)

### Current Defaults
- DCLAUDE_CLAUDE_VERSION=stable (2.1.17)
- DCLAUDE_UV_VERSION=latest (0.9.28+)
- DCLAUDE_GO_VERSION=latest (1.25.6+)
- DCLAUDE_NODE_VERSION=20

### Tested

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- Network firewall with whitelist-based domain filtering using iptables and ipset
- Firewall management commands: `dclaude firewall list|add|remove|reset`
- Three firewall modes: strict (block non-whitelisted), permissive (log only), off
- Default whitelist includes: Anthropic API, GitHub, npm, PyPI, Go modules, Docker Hub, CDNs
- Configuration via DCLAUDE_FIREWALL and DCLAUDE_FIREWALL_MODE environment variables
- Firewall config file at ~/.dclaude/firewall/allowed-domains.txt

- iptables rules: ACCEPT allowed_ips, LOG blocked traffic, DROP everything else

### Tested
- Firewall blocks non-whitelisted domains (google.com, example.com)
- Firewall allows whitelisted domains (api.anthropic.com)
- Domain management commands work correctly
- Firewall initialization works in both run and shell modes
- Persistent and ephemeral container modes both supported
